## Lick Mountain

I managed to sneak out for a really quick backpacking trip over labor day weekend. I had to dig around for something within an hour of where I live and about ten miles in distance.
[Lick Mountain](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/north-carolina/lick-mountain-via-uwharrie-and-dutchmans-creek-loop) seemed like the right fit. 9.6 miles, 'well rated', not too far.

## Hiking and Camping

My plan was to hit the trail no later than 4:30 PM, hike until seven or so, or around halfway, and set up camp. To my pleasant surprise I covered a lot of ground, and I was well past halfway by 6:30 or so.
I ended up finding a suitable pre-existing campsite around 7:15 or so, about 6.6 miles in. I probably could have found a better spot, as the ground here was quite packed down. However there were some nice rocks to sit on while cooking/eating, so I consider that a win.

The terrain was pretty good. There was some elevation change, but nothing too wild and nothing too technical. It was challenging but never more than a quarter mile or so.

The trail itself was well marked, with only one point of confusing. I had to follow a gravel road for a hundred meters or so to find the offshoot from the Uwharrie trail into the Dutchmans Creek Loop, but once there it was well marked. A GPS made this trivial, without that I probably would have wandered a little bit.

Unfortunately the views were limited, with lots of trees everywhere. Fortunately for me this still feels new after a lot of desert hiking, so I don't mind, but I could see it getting old.

On the note of desert hiking, I'm going to have to get used to carrying less water. I'm used to bringing 4+ liters as water sources were scarce out west. Here there was filterable water every mile or more.

## Gear notes

I haven't been out much this year due to moving and COVID, so this was the first time I've used some of my gear in anger. A few notes:

### Dan Durston X-Mid 2P

This tent is super cool. It combines some of the things I like most about my TarpTent Stratospire without some of the downsides of that. It packs easier, without hard struts, and it is much easier to pitch given the rectangular perimeter. I suspect it will be the perfect size for two people and a dog, once we get the whole family out.

There was no real weather this time around so I didn't really put it through its paces, but I was quite pleased with it this time.

### Arc'teryx Remige Sun Hoody

I snagged this on a whim, to contrast with a Black Diamond Alpenglow, and I like it. It is less of a mesh fabric and probably a little less breathable, but fits a little closer which I prefer. Both are great, I'll probably continue to use both of them.

### Hyperlite Mountain Gear (HMG) Versa

The Versa is a crossover fanny-pack/chest strap pack. I've used it a lot around town as a bum bag, but this time I tried it out by attaching it to my backpack's chest straps. Pretty useful, it's nice to have some items more accessible. Ultimately I didn't really need
the space on this trip, and I'm not sure what conditions will actually necessitate putting a couple more liters of storage in front of me, but it's nice to have and it worked well at it.

### HMG stuff sack pillow

This thing is really neat. I used to use an inflatable pillow and while it was nice to elevate my head, it wasn't very comfortable. This is much more comfortable with the fleece lining, but I have so few spare clothes to pack in it that it's a little underfilled. I might need to snag the smaller size
to fix that.

### 'Old' stuff:

- The Hyperlite pack continues to do great, my only regret is that I didn't order a smaller one.
- Titanium pot + Pocket Rocket 2 stove works well and is substantially lighter than my other integrated stove.
- NeoAir Xlite short. Still an adjustment to sleep on a short pad but after enough hiking I'm tired enough to not mind.
- REI Magma Quilt. So nice in the summer. it's great to just throw it off when it gets too hot.
