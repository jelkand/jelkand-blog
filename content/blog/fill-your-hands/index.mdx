Fill Your Hands! is a simple RPG to evoke the spirit of Westerns. Characters must push their luck to win contests or duels.

## Character Creation

Characters have four main attributes used in Contests:

**BRAINS:** The use of cunning, wiles, or cleverness. BRAINS might be used to outwit someone, to treat a wound, to play a game, or to use tactics or strategy.

**BRAWN:** The use of physical force. BRAWN is used when performing feats of athletics. Throwing a punch, breaking down a door, flipping a table, or climbing a building are examples.

**CHARM:** Force of will, persuasiveness, or personality. CHARM might be used to smooth talk, to bluff or cheat at a card game, etc.

**GUN:** The great equalizer. Used when wielding firearms, dynamite, and the like. Contests with GUN are often lethal.

Characters may allocate _THREE_ points between these attributes, and may put more than one point in an attribute if they desire.

## Contests

Conflict or perilous actions are resolved with a push-your luck contest, with similarities to blackjack.

The goal of a contest is to get the highest score possible by summing a series of rolls, without going over 21.

If a character does not have a points in an applicable attribute, they use a D12. If a character has one point in an attribute, they may use a D10 at their discretion. At two or three points, a player may use a D8 or D6 respectively.

When a player starts a contest, they:

1. Explain their intended outcome. The GM tells them the stakes, or what happens if they fail. (e.g. Blondie: "I want to shoot the noose from around Tuco's neck" GM: "If you fail, Tuco will die—since this is high stakes and very difficult you need a 19")
2. They then decide what action they are taking and what attribute it relates to. ("I carefully select a vantage point, using brains.")
3. They then roll their die. If they have points in the attribute, they can roll a smaller die if they like. (Blondie has no points in mind, and rolls a D12 for 8).
4. They repeat steps 2 and 3 until they are satisfied with their score and **stay**, or until they go past 21 and **bust.** (Blondie estimates the range and adjusts the sight on his GUN, in which he has two points, and rolls a D8, rolling a 6 for 14 total. He then takes the shot with GUN. If he rolls an 8, he will bust and lose. He rolls a 5 for 19 total. He stays).
5. If the player wins the roll off, the GM narrates a successful result. If the player loses, they suffer a **consequence** as laid out by the GM.

_Note that the outcome can change based on the actions in the roll-off—if a player pulls a gun at a poker table when things get bad, the results will be different than bluffing their way through._

When a character takes an action against the environment or is the only actor in the action, they roll against a fixed score—a difficult action might require them to beat a 15, a perilous action a 17, and a life-or-death, high stakes action a 19.

When a character starts a contest against an NPC or a player, they take turns rolling until both stay or one busts. The higher score wins. **Players win ties.**

When multiple characters are involved in a contest, the players take turns narrating actions and rolling dice to describe their actions in the contest.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

_Two gunmen step out onto the street at high noon—the first with a sheriff's badge, the second dressed in black. The stakes are lethal—one man will live, one man will die._

_Both roll with GUN the whole way through. Both have one point and can roll a D10 if they choose._

_The sheriff rolls first with a D12 - a 7._

_The man in black rolls next, again with a D12 - a 9._

_The sheriff: a 4, for 11 total._

_The man in black rolls another 9 - 18 in total._

_The sheriff rolls a D10 now, for 4 - 15._

_The man in black stays, and can roll no more._

_The sheriff rolls a D10 again. He needs between a 3 and a 6. He rolls a six—for 21._

_The results are narrated—the man in black pulls his revolver almost faster than the eye can see, but by the time his gun is pointed, the sheriff has put a round of Colt .45 through his heart._

**Example 2:**

_Two cowboys, Clint and John, play a game of high stakes poker against a card shark, to win a herd of cattle. Both are roughnecks, with two points in BRAWN and one point in GUN. The card shark has two points in BRAIN and one point in CHARM._

_The card shark goes first, and plays with BRAIN - 5._

_Clint goes next, rolling a D12 with BRAIN - 1_

_The card shark goes again, with BRAIN - 4, for 9 total._

_John rolls next, rolling a 12 - for 13 total._

_The card shark, seeing that Clint and John are playing a clumsily, switches to a D8, rolling a 6 for 15._

_Clint is up, and dangerously rolls a D12, still using BRAIN. He rolls a 10 - 22 total, and they bust._

_The card shark cleans them out, and wins the shirt off their backs._
