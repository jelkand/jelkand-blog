# Blog

A general purpose blog so I can document my thoughts on tech, tools, and hobbies.

Spun out from gatsby-starter-blog with some modifications to suit my interests.

Some more significant changes:

- Adopting Typescript.
- Adding graphql-codegen to aid typing.
- Using theme-ui as a theme-ing library and ditching typography.
- Migrating to MDX instead of markdown to assist the above
- A good pile of debugging, including moving from `npm` to `yarn` to assist the above.
